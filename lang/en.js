      journal: "Under Review",
      status: "",
      abstract: `This paper explores macroprudential policy implementation within a hierarchical government structure, focusing on the fiscal effects on local governments when the Chinese government restricts financing for real estate developers to address property market risks. Our difference-in-differences approach across Chinese prefecture-level cities provides causal evidence that financing constraints significantly elevate local government debt risk, driven by increased corporate bankruptcies and weakened land markets that reduce primary revenue sources. In response, local governments boost bond issuance, improve non-tax revenue collection, and collaborate with state-owned enterprises to stabilize land markets. Policy implications are also considered.`,

      journal: "Journal of Happiness Studies",
      status: "Reject and Resubmit",
      abstract: `This paper examines how child gender causally affects parental labor supply and well-being by exploiting the quasi-random assignment of firstborn child gender in China. Using data from the China Family Panel Studies (2016-2022) and a two-way fixed effects framework, we find that having a firstborn son increases parental labor force participation by 1.68 percentage points and weekly work hours by 0.82 hours, translating to approximately 3 percent higher labor income. Effects are larger under the One-Child Policy and vary across child development stages. We identify cultural norms and anticipated housing costs for sons' marriages as primary mechanisms, ruling out educational expenses. Despite higher earnings, parents of firstborn sons report lower subjective well-being, with increased working hours serving as the key mediating mechanism. These findings demonstrate how cultural constraints can induce welfare-reducing labor supply decisions.`,

      title: `When Land Expropriation Increases Income: Evidence from China's Structural Transformation`,
      journal: "Journal of Development Studies",
      status: "Revise and Resubmit",
      abstract: `While land expropriation historically impoverished rural populations in developing countries, we find contrasting evidence from China. Using panel data (2010-2018) and difference-in-differences estimation, we show that land expropriation increases household income by 9.3% in the short term, with larger long-term effects. Unlike typical dispossession outcomes, China's expropriation operates through a "reverse pressure mechanism," pushing farmers from agriculture into higher-productivity employment and increasing wage income by 35.5%. Effects are most potent for vulnerable groups: households in western regions (17.1% increase), those highly dependent on agriculture, and those with weaker social networks. Two mechanisms drive these results: compensation-funded financial asset accumulation and forced labor reallocation. China's distinctive outcomes stem from rapid industrialization, providing alternative employment, mandatory compensation, and complementary infrastructure investments, conditions often absent in history. These findings challenge conventional wisdom about land dispossession while highlighting how institutional context determines whether expropriation impoverishes or enriches affected populations.`,

      title: `Corruption Signals and Public Response: Experimental Evidence from China`,
      journal: "Public Administration and Development",
      status: "Revise and Resubmit",
      abstract: `Despite extensive transparency initiatives, a persistent gap exists between anti-corruption messaging and public accountability responses. This experimental study of 963 Chinese citizens examines how corruption information affects citizen willingness to engage in government oversight. Results reveal that direct corruption experiences significantly reduce accountability motivation, with passive bribery recipients showing strongest reluctance. Conversely, media coverage enhances citizen engagement, with data-driven reporting outperforming narrative approaches. Public service satisfaction moderates these relationships—satisfied citizens show reduced responsiveness to transparency initiatives. Paradoxically, both corruption experiences and anti-corruption media initially reduce government fairness perceptions while increasing accountability motivation. For practitioners, findings indicate anti-corruption communications should emphasize quantitative achievements over narratives, and transparency programs must address service delivery problems to maximize citizen oversight engagement.`,
